title: "Final Project Overview"
order: 1
---

The final project is a real AI-enabled application built by a team of 2 to 4 people. Everything you've done this quarter, training models, comparing approaches, building pipelines, deploying inference, comes together here.

The point is to ship something that actually works. A functional proof of concept that you'd genuinely want to use or show someone.

## The requirement

Your application needs **at least 3 ML-based components working together** in a meaningful way. Pretrained models, hosted APIs, and custom-trained pieces all count toward the three. Mixing them is fine and often the right call. What matters is that AI is a **major aspect** of the app, rather than a small feature bolted on the side.

You have full freedom on tech stack. Python, JavaScript, React, Node, mobile, desktop, whatever fits. Architecture decisions are up to your team.

### What "works" means

Your project should:

- **Look reasonable.** A clean interface, even if minimal. Something you'd be willing to demo.
- **Work in the happy path.** Walk through your intended use case end to end without crashing.
- **Be usable.** The core experience should be functional enough that someone could actually try it. Lower-than-production accuracy is fine as long as the app holds together.

## Example: a multi-component AI app

Here's a project I built called [**MTGA-CV-Voice-Interface**](https://github.com/kellerflint/MTGA-CV-Voice-Interface), which lets you play Magic: The Gathering Arena entirely with voice commands. You say something like "play the lightning bolt" and the app actually moves the cursor and clicks for you. It uses four ML components stitched together with software:

- **STT (speech-to-text)** transcribes the spoken command when it detects the end of voice activity
- **YOLO (object detection)**, fine-tuned on MTGA screenshots, finds cards and buttons on screen and returns class labels and bounding boxes
- **OCR (text recognition)** reads the card names and text out of those bounding boxes
- **LLM (language model)** matches the transcribed command against the actual on-screen cards and emits tool calls that drive the cursor, click, and play the right card

Each piece does something the others can't. The LLM alone can't see the screen. YOLO finds where things are but can't read them. OCR reads text but doesn't know which thing the user asked for. STT hears the command but can't act on it. The combination is what makes the whole thing work.

> **With your partner:** Pick one of the AI-enabled apps you use regularly (a search engine, a coding assistant, a photo app, voice assistant, etc.). Try to break it into components. For each component, what AI is probably running, and what could go wrong with that piece in isolation?

## Other component combinations

Lots of stacks work. A few to spark ideas:

- **STT + LLM + Vector/Embedding DB** for a voice-driven research assistant or note-taking tool that searches your own content semantically.
- **YOLO + LLM + TTS (text-to-speech)** for an app that watches a live video feed, describes what's happening, and speaks it back.
- **Custom NN + Traditional ML model + Hosted API** for something domain-specific where you train one piece, use a classical model for structured data, and call out to an LLM or vision API for the rest.
- **Whisper + LLM + Diffusion model** for turning a spoken description into a generated image with iterative voice refinement.

Anything in this neighborhood of complexity works. If your team has a different pitch, bring it up at the review and we'll talk through it.

## AI infrastructure

Running multiple ML components in one app gets expensive fast if you're not careful. A few options that keep costs down or eliminate them:

- **Groq Cloud** offers fast free inference for a variety of model types up to rate limits. Great for LLMs when you want low latency without a credit card.
- **OpenRouter** has a free tier with access to a range of models, plus paid tiers for anything heavier.
- **Azure** has a huge catalog of AI services with significant free credits for students. Worth using for vision, speech, language, and search components specifically.
- **Local inference** for vision models (YOLO, OCR) is often free and fast enough on your laptop. No API calls needed.

Pick infrastructure per component. Mix providers wherever it makes sense, one for vision, another for the LLM, local for the rest.

## Form your teams

Get into groups of 2 to 4 people. Once you have a team, start brainstorming. Aim for ideas where:

- Each person on the team can clearly own a piece of the work
- The components have a real reason to be combined and produce something that none of them could on their own
- You'd actually use the thing if it existed

> **With your partner / team:** What problem do you all run into that an AI app could help with? Start there. It's much easier to build something useful when you're a real user of it.

## Research the pieces

Once you have a candidate idea, do a quick research pass before committing. For each component:

- **Does the model or API exist and is it accessible to you?** Check pricing, free tiers, and rate limits.
- **What does it actually output?** Read the docs or try the API. Don't assume.
- **What's the integration path?** SDK, REST API, local model file, etc.
- **What's the failure mode?** What does it look like when the component fails or returns bad output, and how does the rest of the app handle that?

This research is the bulk of what we'll review together at the project review. Coming in with these questions answered makes the conversation much more productive.
